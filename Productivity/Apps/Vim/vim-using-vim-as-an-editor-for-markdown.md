I've been putting of using Vim for a long-long time. But as I can suggest, it really sspeeds up your workflow.

And even better than what - it actually gives your mind less stuff to worry about (after you conquer steep learning curve, of course). Give it a shot. I'm saying this as a non-believer in Vim and Orgmode for a long-long time.

That's all can muster for today. Stay safe, my friends!
